# reast-Cancer-Detection-using-Random-Forest
A machine learning project that predicts whether a tumor is **benign (0)** or **malignant (1)** based on the *Wisconsin Breast Cancer* dataset, using a Random Forest classifier.   Extensive experimentation was performed including **base model**, **manual tuning**, and **hyperparameter search (RandomizedSearchCV &amp; GridSearchCV)**.
